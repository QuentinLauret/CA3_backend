To use the app, you have to go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
You are then able to create an account or to log in.


When you are logged in, it is possible to register a guitar by clicking on "add a new guitar", or view the existing guitars by clicking on "View all of the guitars".

To add a new guitar you have to set an id, a name, a color, chose if the guitar is an electric one and its price.

#My difficulties

The main issue in this project, was the understanding of the framework. At the beginning, I did not understand how to change the value of my table. But, thanks to the tutorials, I succeeded.
